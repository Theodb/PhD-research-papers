## About

A repository for organizing different topics of machine learning articles in the form of Github's Issues. This idea is inspired by [this arXivTimes repository](https://github.com/yutarochan/arXivTimes) on summarizing machine learning papers.

The website of this repo could be found [here](https://theodb.github.io/phd-research-papers/)
