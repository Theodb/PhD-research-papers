# Research papers repo

A repository for organizing different topics of machine learning articles in the form of Github's Issues.

## How to use it ?

* Check a paper -> Go to the Issues tab where all the papers are listed - you can filter them by labels (Year, topic, author, conference). 
* Add a paper -> Go to the Issues tab and create a new issue, a template will be displayed
