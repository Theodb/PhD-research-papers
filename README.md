# Research papers Articles

A repository for organizing different topics of machine learning articles in the form of Github's Issues.

## How to use it ?

* Check a paper -> Go to the Issues tab where all the papers are listed - you can filter them by labels (Year, topic, author, conference). 
* Add a paper -> Go to the Issues tab and create a new issue, a template will be displayed

  * **TL;DR** - A quick short sentence summary of the paper.
  * **Link to the article.**
  * **Author**
  * **Key Takeaways** - parts of the articles that you find useful.
  * **Useful Code Snippets** - useful codes that you want to save for later
  * **Useful Tools** - useful tools that you want to try out or integrate into your workflow
  * **Comments/Questions** - Your thoughts or questions on the articles. 
    * What do you like about this article? What you wish to learn more from?
