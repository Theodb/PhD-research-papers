## Key Takeaways
*  Give good names to functions and variables
*  Class and static methods are really helpful with methods that do not interact much with attributes inside the class
* Use private attributes when you don't want to show methods that users don't use
* Use subclass within a class
* Code alone should show the purpose of the code
